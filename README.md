# VBA_Excel_Send_Report_Outlook
Create and send a email automatically using Outlook by using VBA macros in Excel. 

This becomes very convenient when a report needs to be sent regularly in a consistent way to a specific group of recipients, with a file that can be updated withinExcel, without opening a previously sent email and changing the information, which is prone to errors if it has to be delivered right away with little time to spare.
We will add a table in the email, and also the Excel file attached.
For this tutorial, we will be using Windows, as at this moment the macro has not been developed for Mac.
